  ## üñ•Ô∏è About booget.rip
- ‚ö° Booget.rip is a simple site that displays some information about myself as well as 2 buttons that go to my GitHub and Codepen. It was made with HTML & CSS and it uses
https://animate.style to create clean and simple animations. I also added particles.js to give of a night time effect by adding in some star particles in the background.
